### Hi, I’m CosmicHail!

I’m a graphic design student passionate about spreading joy and creativity through my art. I constantly strive to grow and improve, welcoming feedback that helps me develop both personally and professionally.

I value honesty and appreciate direct communication, even when the truth is hard to hear. In relationships, I am loyal, caring, and empathetic, always seeking to support those close to me.

I love connecting with others—especially when communication is clear and straightforward!
